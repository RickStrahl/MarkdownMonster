# Markdown Monster ToDo List

### Bugs

#### Enhancements
* [ ] Command Line option to open document at a given line
* [ ] Refactor file names (rename and fix up relative links)
* [ ] Commit/push all changes in the folder to Git
* [ ] Undocking tabs? :smiley:
* [ ] Redesign the Addin Manager Load Behavior
        * Addin Enabled/Disabled
        * Check for Updates
        * Check for incompatible versions
        * Auto-Update?
* [ ] Large, Large Document Performance  

### Nice to Have
* [ ] Search for Blog Posts in Weblog Posts folder (walk tree and show titles)
* [ ] Add JavaScript {{Handlebars}} Processing to Snippets Addin


### Consideration
* [ ] Markup (Publishing) support
* [ ] reveal.js presentations
* [ ] Research **R Markdown**, **AsciiDoc**
* [ ] Switch to using WebView2 instead of Ie Web Browser Control
      * Reviewed and looks viable in terms of features and interop
      * WebView2 is still in Preview so distribution problematic
      * Much bigger memory footprint than IE control
        

### Table Editor
* [ ] Alignment in tables would be nice
* [ ] Would be nice to be able to re-sort tables somehow based on a certain column
* [ ] It takes quite a while to open the editor for a larger table
* [ ] And then trying to add another column to that table is even slower
