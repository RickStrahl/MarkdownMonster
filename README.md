> #### Beta Notice
> This tool is still under construction and in pre-release stage. Most of the editing and document management features are implemented, but there are a still a few rough edges.

### Why another Markdown Editor?
Markdown is everywhere these days, and it's becoming a favorite for many developers, writers and documentation experts to create content in this format. Personally I use Markdown for my Blog, my MessageBoard, of course on GitHub and in a number of applications that deal with formatted text. Having an editor that gets out of your way, yet provides a few helpful features **and lets you add custom features** that make your content creation sessions more productive are important.

Markdown Monster is a Markdown editor for Windows, that provides basic editing functionality. It works, nothing revolutionary here. You get a responsive text editor that's got you covered with Markdown syntax highlighting, an collapsible live preview, so you can see what your output looks like, inline spellchecking and a handful of optimized menu options that help you embed and link content into your markdown.

### Customizable
Most features are optional and can be turned on and off. Want to work distraction free and see no preview or spell checking hints? You can turn things off. Want a different editor or preview theme, just switch it to one of the many editor themes and preview themes available. 

The editor is HTML and JavaScript based, so you can also apply any custom styling and even hook up custom JavaScript code if you want to get fancy beyond the basic configurability. The preview themes are easy to modify HTML templates, so if you need to create a custom format so it matches an application's style it's quite easy to create a custom Preview theme.

### Extensibility with .NET Add-ins
But the **key feature** and the main reason I built this tool is that it is **extensible**, so that you and I can plug additional functionality into it. Markdown Monster includes an add-in model that lets you add buttons to the UI, interact with the active document and the entire UI and get notifications of various events like  documents opening and closing etc..

The Add-in interface is still in flux, but you can find out more in the [online documention](http://markdownmonster.west-wind.com/docs/_4ne0rl1zf.htm). If you have ideas or suggestions  on how to make the Add-in system better, please use the Issue system to provide feedback. Otherwise for general discussion you can [post a message on our message board](http://support.west-wind.com?forum=Markdown+Monster).

### Provided Add-ins
Personally I needed couple of features - and I've added two add-ins for these features both for practical use as well as examples of what you can do with plug-ins:

* **SnagIt Screen Capture Addin**  
This plug-in use Techsmith's popular and super versatile [SnagIt](http://techsmith.com/snagit) Screen Capture utility (which i **highly** recommend!). Simply click the capture button (camera icon) and the main app minimizes and SnagIt pops up to let you select the object to capture. You can preview and edit your captures, and when finished the image is linked into content.

* **WebLog Addin**  
Writing long blog posts is one thing I do a lot of and this is one of the reasons I actually wanted an integrated solution in a Markdown editor. You can take any Markdown and turn it into a blog post by using the blog tool, setting up your blog (MetaWebLog or WordPress) and the add-in handles publishing your text and attached images to your blog. Currently you can't only write (not read) but managing and loading existing posts is one feature on the list.

I can think of a few others - a quick way to commit to Git and Push would be useful for documentation solutions so you can easily persist changes to say a GitHub repository. Embedding all sorts of content like reference links, amazon links etc. etc.

Or maybe you have custom applications that use Markdown text and provide an API that allows you to post the Markdown (or HTML) to the server. It's easy to build a custom add-in that lets you take either the Markdown text or rendered HTML and push it to a custom REST interface in your custom application.

## Acknowledgements
This application heavily leans several third party libraries without which this tool would not have been possible. Many thanks for the producers of these libraries:

* **[Ace Editor](https://ace.c9.io)**  
Ace Editor is a power HTML based editor platform that makes it easy to plug syntax highlighted software style editing possible in a browser. Markdown Monster uses Ace Editor for the main Markdown editing experience inside of a Web browser control that interacts with the WPF application.

* **[MahApps.Metro](http://mahapps.com/)**  
This library provides the Metro style window and theming support of the top level application shell.

* **[Dragablz](https://dragablz.net/)**  
This library provides the tab control support for the editor allowing for nicely styled tab reordering and overflow. Although not used in Markdown Monster the library also supports tab tear off tabs and layout docking.

* **[CommonMark.NET](https://github.com/Knagis/CommonMark.NET)**  
This is the markdonwn parser used to render markdown in the preview editor. CommonMark.NET is fast and easy to work with and has an excellent extensibility interface.

## License
Although we provide the source in the open, Markdown Monster is licensed software.

Markdown Monster can  be downloaded and evaluated for free, but a [reasonably priced license](http://store.west-wind.com/product/MARKDOWN_MONSTER) must be purchased for continued use. Licenses are per user, rather than per machine, so you can use Markdown Monster on as many computers you wish with your license. 

Thanks for playing fair.
